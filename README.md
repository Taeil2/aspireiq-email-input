# Frontend Take Home: Email Input

This is my submission for AspireIQ's frotnend exercise.

## Changes and Improvements

I didn't finish a few styling things. In the autocomplete, the scrollbar styling does not match the design. It also does not have the fade at the bottom. When the entries get too long, a horizontal scrollbar appears for the input box. A better implementation might have been to incorporate a thinner and sleeker scrollbar. Or the box could grow vertically as entries are added.

For autocomplete functionality, I would like to enable keyboard input on the as well. Also, the data is not ordered in any way, so alphabetical ordering might have helped.

I might also add a tooltip on an invalid email address, saying that it is an invalid email address.
